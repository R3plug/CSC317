## Analysis

The initial hand-written stylesheet took by far the longest. I did not have a clear concept when I first started so there was a lot of trial and error to create a cohesive style for the page. I also spent a lot of time playing with differentstyling tools and page formats before I landed on something I liked. For the AI generated pages, the second one using a picture as reference came out much better. I referenced it a lot more in my final hybrid page. The first AI CSS had a very clean look but nothing really stood out to me. The main thing going forward that I want to practice more is to utilize classes more. I think I could increase the reusability of code which could increase performance. 

My favorite stylesheet is the hybrid one. I was able to revist my hand-written one after a little time to grab just the stuff I really liked from it and the ai-2 stylesheet had some great ideas that I think made the page feel a little cleaner.
