## Analysis
I created a recreation of the iOS calculator with added memory functions and a theme switcher. I had some issues implementing the +/- operation and my final solution is not as robust as the real ios calculator. I just add parenthatses and a minus sign but in the regular calculator it can swap the sign from minus to plus and you can keep clicking the button to swap the sign. I also have run into an issue with github pages when traversing from the portfolio to the calculator and back. It breaks the style then I have to select a theme from the theme switcher for the stylesheet to be applied. I have not found a solution yet to this. In the future I would extend the functionality to a scientific caluclator and have the clear button change to a backspace button when there is stuff on the input screen. I used the previously provided theme switcher code and the safeEval code. I also used chat GPT to generate the second stylesheet. I had to change the layout settings to make the buttons sit correctly. I watched tutorials from several youtube channels to figure out the button and keyboard input, and various formatting including Net Ninja, Snippets Code, bro code, dcode, and coding 2 go.
